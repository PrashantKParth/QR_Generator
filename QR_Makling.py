#Importing the 'qrcode' library
import qrcode as qr

#Here, the code imports the 'qrcode' library and renames it to 'qr' for convenience.
#This library allows you to create QR codes easily.



#Generating the QR code:
img = qr.make("https://github.com/prashantkparth")

#In this line, the 'qr.make()' function is used to generate a QR code.
#The function takes a single argument, which is the data you want to encode into the QR code.
#In this case, it's a URL: "https://github.com/prashantkparth".
#The function returns a QR code object, which is stored in the variable 'img'.


#Saving the QR code as an image:
img.save("GitHub_Prashant.png")

#After generating the QR code, the code saves it as an image file named "GitHub_Prashant.png".
#The 'save()' method is called on the QR code object ('img'),and it specifies the filename to save the image as.

#The image will be saved in the same directory where the Python script is executed.


'''To summarize, this code generates a QR code containing the URL "https://github.com/prashantkparth" and saves it as an image file named "GitHub_Prashant.png".
When scanned, the QR code would direct a QR code scanner to open the specified URL.'''
